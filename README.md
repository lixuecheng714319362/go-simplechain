## Building the source

Building sipe requires both a Go (version 1.13 or later) and a C compiler.
You can install them using your favourite package manager.
Once the dependencies are installed, run
```bash
make sipe
```
    
## Run tests
```bash
make test
```

in additional, blockchain tests of the scrypt consensus, need download simplechain-org/testdata

```bash
git submodule update --init
make test
```

## Running sipe

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://github.com/simplechain-org/go-simplechain/wiki/Command-Line-Options)), but we've
enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly on how you can run your
own Sipe instance.

### Full node on the main Simplechain network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Simplechain network:
create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this particular use-case
the user doesn't care about years-old historical data, so we can fast-sync quickly to the current
state of the network. To do so:

```
$ sipe console
```

This command will:

 * Start sipe in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag), causing it to
   download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history of the Simplechain network,
   which is very CPU intensive.
 * Start up Sipe's built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://github.com/simplechain-org/go-simplechain/wiki/JavaScript-Console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can invoke all official [`web3` methods](https://github.com/simplechain-org/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API)
   as well as Sipe's own [management APIs](https://github.com/simplechain-org/go-simple/wiki/Management-APIs).
   This too is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running Sipe instance
   with `Sipe attach`.

### Full node on the Simplechain test network

Transitioning towards developers, if you'd like to play around with creating Simplechain contracts, you
almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until you get the hang of the
entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main network, you want to join the **test**
network with your node, which is fully equivalent to the main network, but with play-Ether only.

```
$ sipe --testnet console
```

The `console` subcommand have the exact same meaning as above and they are equally useful on the
testnet too. Please see above for their explanations if you've skipped to here.

Specifying the `--testnet` flag however will reconfigure your Sipe instance a bit:

 * Instead of using the default data directory (`~/.simplechain` on Linux for example), Sipe will nest
   itself one level deeper into a `testnet` subfolder (`~/.simplechain/testnet` on Linux). Note, on OSX
   and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node requires the use of a custom
   endpoint since `sipe attach` will try to attach to a production node endpoint by default. E.g.
   `sipe attach <datadir>/testnet/sipe.ipc`. Windows users are not affected by this.
 * Instead of connecting the main Simplechain network, the client will connect to the test network,
   which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis states.
   

*Note: Although there are some internal protective measures to prevent transactions from crossing
over between the main network and test network, you should make sure to always use separate accounts
for play-money and real-money. Unless you manually move accounts, Sipe will by default correctly
separate the two networks and will not make any accounts available between them.*


### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `sipe` binary, you can also pass a configuration file via:

```
$ sipe --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to export your existing configuration:

```
$ sipe --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

### Programatically interfacing Sipe nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with Sipe and the Simplechain
network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid this, Sipe has built-in
support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://github.com/simplechain-org/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) and
[Sipe specific APIs](https://github.com/simplechain-org/go-simplechain/wiki/Management-APIs)). These can be
exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (unix sockets on unix based platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by Sipe, whereas the HTTP
and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a subset of APIs due to security reasons.
These can be turned on/off and configured as you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--rpc` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--rpcaddr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: "localhost")
  * `--rpcport` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: 8545)
  * `--rpcapi` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: "eth,net,web3")
  * `--rpccorsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--wsaddr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: "localhost")
  * `--wsport` WS-RPC server listening port (default: 8546)
  * `--wsapi` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: "eth,net,web3")
  * `--wsorigins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: "admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3")
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to connect
via HTTP, WS or IPC to a Sipe node configured with the above flags and you'll need to speak [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
on all transports. You can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based transport before
doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert Simplechain nodes with exposed APIs!
Further, all browser tabs can access locally running webservers, so malicious webpages could try to
subvert locally available APIs!**
